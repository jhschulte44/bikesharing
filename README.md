# Bikesharing 
## Overview
Our client is interested in starting a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, and tasked us with analyzing NYC Citibike data to determine some key information about how people use bike sharing. Below is a link to our Tableau dashboard with detailed visuals and statistics from our analysis.

## Results
Based on our analysis, there are several key observations we can make:
  - The duration of most rides do not exceed 40 minutes
  - The majority of customers are annual subscribers and male
  - A high concentration of bikes are used on weekdays between 7am-9am and 4pm-7pm  

Each of these observations seem to indicate that the bikesharing program is most useful as an alternative way to commute to-and-from work during the weekday. 

## Summary
While the Citbike program works well in a high-density city like New York as a method of transportation for work, it is unclear if using a bikesharing program in Des Moines would be comparalbe. Some additional research could be done around the types of customers, whether they are tourists or residents, and perhaps some data on the upkeep costs of maintaining the bikes.
